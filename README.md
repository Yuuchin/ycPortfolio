Research Topic:
Libraries and frameworks

Problem statement: 
Nowadays, websites all look alike and are boring and predictable due to the existence of bootstrap. I am not against bootstrap. I think bootstrap is a life-saver for back-end programmers who are weak in design and hence they are a neccesity. However, people are killing creativity by using it as a crutch in frontend webdev.

Research Question: 
Are frameworks and libraries going to replace the need of CSS skills in frontend webdev?

Hypothesis:
No. Frameworks and libraries works by providing a fixed layout / functionality which may suit the general website needs, such as e-commerce and social sites. However , for a certain niche which require a lot of customization, such as the entertainment or creative industry, will need designs and functions that is not available in frameworks and libraries. 

Aim:
1) I seek to challenge my front-end skill and make my website as non-bootstrap-looking as possible 
2) To find my target audience categorize them into needing bootstrap versus needing css

Objectives: 
1) Find out what it takes to come up with a fully-functional e-commerce website (browse, compare, choose, checkout)
2) Find out what it takes to come up with a fully-customized interactive website (with advanced multimedia components)
3)

Conclusion:
