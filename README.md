Research Topic:
Libraries and frameworks in frontend web dev

Problem statement: 
Nowadays, websites all look alike and are boring and predictable due to the existence of bootstrap. I am not against bootstrap. I think bootstrap is a life-saver for back-end programmers who are weak in design and hence they are a necessity. However, people are killing creativity by using it as a crutch in frontendÂ web dev.

Research Question: 
How will frameworks and libraries replace the need for CSS skills in front-end web dev?

Hypothesis:
Frameworks and libraries work by providing a fixed layout/functionality which may suit the general website needs, such as e-commerce and social sites. In this case, a basic understanding of CSS, frameworks, and libraries will work. However, a certain niche that requires a lot of customization, such as the entertainment or creative industry, will need designs and functions that are not available in frameworks and libraries, and a full understanding of CSS will still be needed. 

Aim:
1) I seek to challenge my front-end skill and make my website as non-bootstrap-looking as possible 
2) To find my target audience categorize them into needing bootstrap versus needing CSS

Objectives: 
1) Find out what it takes to come up with a fully-functional e-commerce website (browse, compare, choose, checkout)
2) Find out what it takes to come up with a fully-customized interactive website (with advanced multimedia components)
3)
