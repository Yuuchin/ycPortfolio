# ycPortfolio
Problem statement: 
Nowadays, websites all look alike and are boring and predictable due to the existence of bootstrap. I am not against bootstrap. I think bootstrap is a life-saver for back-end programmers who are weak in design and hence they are a neccesity. However, people are killing creativity by using it as a crutch in frontend webdev.

Aim:
I seek to challenge my front-end skill and make my website as non-bootstrap-looking as possible. 

Objectives: 
1) landing page for a self-introduction
2) Categorize and showcase all the Adobe, frontend, and backend projects that I've done
3) Implement at least a simple database in the portfolio
4) Implement at least one advanced multimedia component (3D rendering and live animation, interactive)
5) Take advantage of at least a jQuery / bootstrap or any framework / library in at least one page

Happy for feedback but strict in doing most of the work as this is a portfolio after all~
