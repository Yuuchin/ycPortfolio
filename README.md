### Research Topic:
Libraries and frameworks in frontend web dev

### Introduction and Overview:
1.
2.

### Problem statement: 
Nowadays, websites all look alike and are boring and predictable due to the existence of bootstrap. I am not against bootstrap. I think bootstrap is a life-saver for back-end programmers who are weak in design and hence they are a necessity. However, people are killing creativity by using it as a crutch in frontendÂ web dev.

### Research Question: 
How will frameworks and libraries replace the need for CSS skills in front-end web dev?

### Hypothesis:
Frameworks and libraries work by providing a fixed layout/functionality which may suit the general website needs, such as e-commerce and social sites. In this case, a basic understanding of CSS, frameworks, and libraries will work. However, a certain niche that requires a lot of customization, such as the entertainment or creative industry, will need designs and functions that are not available in frameworks and libraries, and a full understanding of CSS will still be needed. 

### Aim:
1. To challenge my front-end skill and make my website as non-bootstrap-looking as possible 
2. To find my target audience and categorize them into needing bootstrap versus needing CSS
3. To identify the different roles of CSS / frameworks / libraries in different kinds of websites

### Objectives: 
1. Find out what it takes to come up with a fully-functional e-commerce website 
2. Find out what it takes to come up with a fully-customized creative website 

### Expected outcome: (what will be produced and submitted in the project)
1. A creative website that is also an e-commerce platform 
2.

### Method:
1. Make a list of deliverables that e-commerce websites will need (i.e. ability to browse, compare, choose, checkout)
2. Make a list of deliverables that creative websites will need (i.e. intergrating advanced multimedia components like 3D rendering and animation)
3. Compare how many deliverables are met in a fixed duration of time (i.e. 2 hours) using frameworks versus not using them
