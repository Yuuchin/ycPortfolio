# ycPortfolio

Aims of the portfolio website: 
1) landing page for a self-introduction
2) Categorize and showcase all the Adobe, frontend, and backend projects that I've done
3) Implement at least a simple database in the portfolio
4) Implement at least one advanced multimedia component (3D rendering and live animation, must be interactive)
5) Take advantage of at least a jQuery / bootstrap or any framework / library in at least one page

Happy for feedback but strict in doing most of the work as this is a portfolio after all~
more desc in time to come
