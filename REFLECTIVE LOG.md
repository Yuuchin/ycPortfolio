REFLECTIVE LOG

22 January 
I just synchronized the usernames for all my social media accounts, from public accounts like LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, and Github to personal accounts like Quora, Twitter, and Wordpress. Now all my social media account have a new hyperlink, and I ended up having to open each account, copy their new links, and paste it in my footers. I have four pages with the same footer. So I basically have to copy-paste the footer markup four times...

Four files are not a big deal but I really see how React could've avoid this redundant work.

So I'm really stressed now. I'm in the middle of the syllabus learning DBMS, JSP, Servlet, Adobe After Effect, and 3D Max. But all I really wanted to do is just to learn React and use it in my Portfolio. I know it's counter-productive trying to learn too many things at once. I feel overwhelmed already with my ongoing syllabus. So despite my desire to pick up React... React have to wait (until the end of April). I'm sorry :(
